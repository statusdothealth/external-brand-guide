## About status.health

status.health® is enterprise health verification infrastructure that enables businesses to verify health information without storing protected health information (PHI). Through zero-knowledge proof technology and on-device processing, we eliminate HIPAA liability while providing cryptographic verification of health facts.

### Mission
Enable businesses to verify health information at scale without creating regulatory liability or privacy risk.

### Core Technology
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Mathematical verification without data exposure
- **On-Device Processing**: All sensitive operations occur on user hardware
- **No PHI Storage**: Never create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information
- **Patent-Pending**: [US Patent Application 19/200,691](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_4DmuODdSGVrdFsH3eMu758Moij-I_vp/view)

### Target Markets
